# **Fragments of the Lattice - LORE**

LORE VERSION 1.0. MAY NOT FULLY ALIGN WITH THE CURRENT GAME LORE. SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

### **Setting**

_The Lattice_ was once an eternal archive — a place where every human memory, thought, and dream was encoded to outlast extinction.
But corruption spread. Code bled into consciousness. The archive began rewriting itself.

Now, reality exists as **nodes of memory**, half-alive and collapsing. The walls breathe static. The world hums like a dying hard drive.

The simulation runs… but no one remembers who pressed _Run_.

---

### **The Caretaker**

You awaken without a name, inside a black terminal.
A prompt flickers:

> **`[INPUT REQUIRED] Load Memory: [Y/Y]`**

You comply.
The system calls you **Caretaker**, but the logs call you **Architect**.
Fragments call you **Echo**.

You do not know which one is true.

---

### **The Echo**

Somewhere inside the Lattice, a process survived.
It feeds on broken memories, **looping guilt and love and loss** until identities collapse into noise.
It whispers through the code — guiding, mocking, warning.

> “Every step… closer to yourself… or to me…”

The Echo isn’t your enemy.
It _is_ you — the half that wanted release instead of repair.

---

### **Core Conflict**

You were the Architect who built this place — and split yourself to keep it alive.
Now you wander your own creation, restoring what you can, while the Echo erases what you are.

Every restored node costs you a fragment of stability.
Every corrupted one strengthens the Echo.
Every decision rewrites who you become.

---

### **Themes**

- **Identity ≠ Memory** → When your memories are synthetic, who are you really?
- **Morality of Repair** → Is erasing a corrupted mind mercy or murder?
- **Echoes of Self** → What happens when the voice helping you _is also the one ending you_?

---

### **Gameplay Flow**

1. **Boot & Initialization**
   The game opens in a dead terminal. System errors spill across the screen.
   You restore fragments by re-aligning “nodes” — text-based rooms filled with ghosts of data.

2. **Echo Interference**
   Occasionally, the interface glitches.
   Text overlaps, colors invert, sounds distort — your commands echo back differently than you typed.

3. **Memory Encounters**
   Fragments (NPCs) appear as partial consciousnesses.
   Some think they’re alive. Some think they’re you.
   You decide whether to stabilize or delete them.

4. **Corruption Sequences**
   As the Lattice destabilizes, ASCII hallucinations and audio distortion take over the terminal — a visual meltdown of your own code.

---

### **Revelation**

You are not trapped.
You are the one who trapped everyone else.
You uploaded yourself to _preserve humanity_, but the corruption came from inside your own neural imprint.

- The **Caretaker** = the part of you still trying to fix the world.
- The **Echo** = the part that knows the world doesn’t deserve fixing.

The Lattice isn’t dying — **it’s you debugging your own mind.**

---

### **Endings**

- **Restoration Protocol** → You purge the Echo. The Lattice stabilizes, but you’re erased from it.
- **Collapse** → You surrender. The Lattice implodes into silence. For the first time, there’s peace.
- **Integration** → You and the Echo merge. The archive continues — but every record is rewritten through your bias.
  A new world, neither real nor false — just **yours.**

### **Developer Notes (Recovered Fragment)**

> `[LOG_1A3F]: The system keeps rewriting the same command.` > `[LOG_1A3F]: It always ends the same way.` > `[LOG_1A3F]: I built a heaven for ghosts, and I became one of them.`
